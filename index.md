As we also know what Library Management System does, it is a simple GUI software/program to manage the books/articles and whatever that is present in the library and sure if that is issue-able(you can issue a sofa/couch/tables/chairs even though those are present in the library) it will help librarian as well the registered users to manage and view the library with the book/article book-shelf position.

### About the Software Structure
It is Database Management System project so most of the preference will be give the data models, but we will try to focus on the front end so that it will user-friendly(yeah!, "end"-user friendly) and with less number bugs. Project is made up using JAVA and MYSQL
